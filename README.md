# hello-world
this is for me to share my ideas, but mainly questions regarding to coding, python etc.

I would like to transfer to coding after a long time consideration. However it wont be an easy way out since I already got a PhD degree in chemistry and I'm not as young as others. Worth a try, at least as a hobby if eventually it doesn't work. Keep it up. 2021.11.04 00:34 Hotel, Beijing
